How to install:
Simply clone or download this repo and add it as a local extension.

Features:
- **Replace tile text** with images (32 px height) defined in a JSON mapping.  
- **Add colored badges** (e.g. `CASADE`, `SAND`, `LAKE`, `ALL`) to each tile based on its “kingdom.”  
- **“Load Images”** button lets you manually (re‑)apply the image/badge overlay.  
- Works in all Chromium‑based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera, Vivaldi) under Manifest V3.

Additional Notes:
- The button may appear on other games, but it won’t have any functionality there.
- It won’t do anything while the board cover is still active.
- To switch back to the standard text-only squares, simply refresh your browser.
- The extension might not play nicely with all other extensions — it’s only been tested with Bingosync counters, which seem to work fine alongside it.

Planned Features:
- Automatically update the board when it’s generated or revealed
- Allow users to customize kingdom badge color coding
- Let users choose which types of goals should be replaced with images (e.g., only regional coins)
